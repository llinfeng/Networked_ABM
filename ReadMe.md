# Introduction
This repo is meant to be my **collection** of relevant Agent-Based Models that are
crafted to capture strategic interactions and structural adaptation that are
taking place in a network setting.

## Acknowledge
Linfeng is still at an early stage for this collection. Please do not hesitate
to let me know if you find anything that is marginally related. Thank you!
